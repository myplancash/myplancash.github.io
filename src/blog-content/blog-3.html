    <h2>Ensuring Error-Free Software</h2>
    <p>Effectively debugging applications is a cornerstone of programming. After creating a React App, an important next step
    is setting up your environment to debug it. We'll cover the basics in this article using the initial skeleton created by
    using create-react-app.
    This article assumes you are familiar with create-react-app and Chrome DevTools. We're also going to be briefly touching
    on state and props within a component, so it's best if you have a basic understanding of these concepts before
    proceeding with this article!
    We've included this article in video form too. You can watch here or scroll down to keep reading!</p>
